# Estado da missão autônoma — Ollama DZ23 Agentic Platform

```yaml
mission_id: dz23-agentic-platform-2026-09-21
objective: Evoluir o Ollama DZ23 para uma plataforma agentic local-first com execução segura, ferramentas, memória, artefatos, automações, integrações e superfícies Desktop/Mobile.
state: RECOVERING
iteration: 1
started_at: 2026-09-21
last_progress_at: 2026-09-21
branch: feat/dz23-claude-codex-desktop
base_commit: 4a3dd89ed9224f2d6cd87579434ca6798334fa4a

acceptance:
  - O núcleo de missão possui estados explícitos, persistência, eventos e recuperação.
  - Toda ferramenta possui contrato, limites, autorização e resultado auditável.
  - Terminal e execução de código são isolados por política; não há shell arbitrário por padrão.
  - Memória, projetos, skills, MCP, artefatos e jobs têm fronteiras versionadas.
  - Browser/computer-use, integrações externas, mídia, Web/Desktop/Mobile têm adapters testáveis.
  - Fluxos críticos têm testes unitários, contrato, integração, segurança e smoke real.
  - Nenhuma capacidade é marcada como completa sem prova observável.

completed:
  - Auditoria do commit 4a3dd89e e confirmação da base multi-provider.
  - Ponte Anthropic Messages para providers OpenAI-compatible.
  - Inventário externo para Claude Desktop e Codex Desktop.
  - Testes focados de multillm, proxy e launch.

current_task: Arquitetura e núcleo vertical de missões.
pending:
  - Runtime de missão com planner, executor, observer e recovery.
  - Store durável, eventos e idempotência.
  - Tool registry, approvals, sandbox e artifacts.
  - Memória/projetos/skills/MCP.
  - Browser/computer-use e integrações.
  - Mídia, builder, jogos, slides, dados e mobile.
  - Auditorias independentes, build e publicação.

blockers:
  - GitHub push bloqueado por 403 para a identidade dz23trading-collab.
  - Build nativo completo depende das toolchains de cada plataforma.
  - Integrações externas reais dependem de credenciais e autorização do usuário.

risks:
  - Execução de shell, browser, desktop e conectores podem produzir efeitos externos; exigir aprovação e allowlists.
  - Não implementar browser/computer-use falso baseado apenas em respostas do modelo.
  - Não persistir segredos em missão, memória, logs ou artefatos.

next_action: Criar contratos agentic e implementar uma missão vertical persistente com ferramenta segura de filesystem.
```

## Regra de retomada

Antes de continuar, conferir este arquivo contra `git status`, o commit atual, os testes e os artefatos. Retomar pela primeira tarefa não concluída; não repetir a ponte Claude/Codex já validada.

  - PostgreSQL/RLS, Redis, OTLP, IdP, Docker/staging distribuído
  - runners Windows/macOS, GPU, dispositivos móveis, assinatura e lojas

current_task: publicar somente a camada de hardening local já implementada; depois iniciar tenant isolation por testes negativos
next_actions:
  - revisar diff e atualizar este checkpoint com o SHA publicado
  - commit/push sem merge para main e confirmar PR #1
  - criar duas organizações em teste HTTP e provar 403/no mutation em Builder, Company/Growth, orchestration, traces e devices
  - atualizar novamente a auditoria apenas com evidência reproduzível
classification: preview/local RC em hardening; NÃO final, NÃO production-ready
rollback: reverter o commit deste slice na branch feature; não force-push e não alterar main

## Follow-up mobile dependency audit — 2026-09-22

A triagem do `npm audit --omit=dev` mostrou que os 18 achados vinham de transitivos do Expo 53/React Native 0.79: `image-size`, `postcss` e `uuid`. Em vez de executar `npm audit fix --force` e migrar majors sem validação, foram adicionados overrides mínimos (`image-size@2.0.4`, `postcss@8.5.28`, `uuid@11.1.1`). Após resolver o lock, o typecheck, Expo web export e `npm audit --omit=dev` passaram; o audit agora reporta `0` vulnerabilidades de produção. A migração Expo/React Native major continua uma tarefa separada que exige testes Android/iOS físicos.

## Complemento de lifecycle na UI — 2026-09-22

O commit `eb97e6b808f2130071eaf12a85d98c0488d6b83a` completou a superfície de lifecycle no frontend. Connectors, MCP/Remote MCP e skills agora possuem remoção explícita com confirmação, além de habilitar/desabilitar; a mensagem deixa claro que remover o manifest local não revoga a credencial no upstream. O build TypeScript/Vite e os 21 arquivos de teste UI, totalizando 204 testes, passaram. A branch foi publicada e permaneceu limpa após o push.

A classificação não muda: preview/local RC em hardening. CI remoto do head mais recente continua aguardando conclusão; não é declarado verde por inferência do gate local.


## Hardening de parsing estrito de manifestos — 2026-09-22

A auditoria P1 encontrou que os novos loaders persistentes de MCP e Remote MCP aceitavam um primeiro JSON válido mesmo quando havia um segundo valor após ele. O commit `89b4203e9b6815ce9be535edf077fe2231b737e6` agora exige `io.EOF` após o primeiro documento; conteúdo trailing produz erro de bootstrap e não é parcialmente aplicado. Foram adicionadas regressões para `[] {}` nos dois loaders.

Evidências: testes normais e race dos managers persistentes passaram; integrity passou; o gate completo Go passou com `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./... -count=1 -timeout=900s`, `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...` e `git diff --check`. Nenhum fallback foi relaxado. O SHA foi publicado na branch de revisão; CI pública do head permanece separada da evidência local até conclusão.


## Harmonização de parsing strict dos manifests persistentes — 2026-09-22

A auditoria cruzada encontrou o mesmo padrão no `NewPersistentConnectorManager`: o decoder aceitava o primeiro array e ignorava conteúdo JSON posterior. O commit `5816c020b83993007d91adee420c5bac4e1d7d3c` adicionou a exigência de EOF ao loader de connectors e uma regressão para `[] {}`. Agora connectors, MCP e Remote MCP usam parsing estrito e falham fechado quando há documento trailing.

Os testes normal e race do connector manager passaram. O gate completo pós-harmonização passou em integrity, `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./...`, vet, build e diff. O tree segue publicado na branch pública; a CI remota do head mais recente permanece sujeita ao workflow do GitHub.


## Hardening do bootstrap estático de connectors — 2026-09-22

O commit `f78fa0d6c49dc956f8db71452f70f19390c46fee` substituiu o `json.Unmarshal` do loader `OLLAMA_AGENT_CONNECTORS` por `decodeAgentConfigJSON`. O bootstrap estático agora rejeita campos desconhecidos e JSON trailing, alinhando-se aos manifests persistentes. Testes específicos cobrem os dois casos em normal e race.

O gate completo após a mudança passou em integrity, `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./... -count=1 -timeout=900s`, vet, build e diff. A configuração por arquivo de ambiente continua explicitamente estática; nenhuma mutation da UI é apresentada como edição desse arquivo. A CI pública do head mais recente continua separada da evidência local.


## Fechamento do strict decode da família de plugins — 2026-09-22

O commit `8630090062c437c1de1fc3f8e779c3963f57c58a` endureceu `ContextStore.LoadSkillsForOrganization`. Manifestos de skills agora usam `DisallowUnknownFields` e exigem EOF após o documento principal; `trusted` e `enabled` continuam derivados pelo servidor. Regressões cobrem campo desconhecido e documento trailing, além dos testes de persistência e trust fail-closed existentes.

O gate completo pós-mudança passou em integrity, `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./... -count=1 -timeout=900s`, vet, build e diff. Com isso, connectors, MCP, Remote MCP e skills têm parsing estrito tanto no bootstrap/persistência aplicável quanto nas regressões. O head de código foi publicado; a documentação deste checkpoint será o próximo commit.


## Hardening P1 de logout local — 2026-09-22

A auditoria de auth encontrou que `POST /api/agent/v1/auth/logout` exigia um Bearer e acessava o AuthStore mesmo quando `auth_required=false`. O commit `0ea1039aba7d50014d7422cd40b69355e8451ed7` torna o endpoint idempotente no modo local: retorna `204 No Content` sem sessão e sem AuthStore. No modo autenticado, a revogação Bearer continua obrigatória e não muda de escopo.

Foi adicionada regressão local, além do teste existente que prova revogação do bearer. Testes normal/race específicos passaram e os gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. O contrato não declara que logout local revoga conta externa; ele apenas encerra a ausência de sessão do runtime local.


## Hardening P1 de Origin/CSRF no modo local — 2026-09-22

A auditoria de auth identificou que `auth_required=false` pulava `agentOriginAllowed` e deixava mutações locais sem a política de origem, embora o serviço pudesse ser acessado por um navegador. O commit `79a1197e2e9e857090c32f22c290c1c457a35207` aplica a mesma verificação no ramo local. Origens loopback padrão (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1` e `0.0.0.0`, HTTP/HTTPS e portas) continuam permitidas; uma origem cross-site recebe `403` em métodos de mutação. Leituras, preflight e requests sem Origin preservam o comportamento compatível.

Foi adicionada regressão de middleware local cross-site, além da matriz de `agentOriginAllowed`. Testes normal/race específicos e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. O modo local continua sem bearer por desenho, mas agora não trata ausência de autenticação como ausência de política de navegador.


## Hardening P1 de wildcard de Origin — 2026-09-23

A revisão da política de origem encontrou que o matcher anterior tratava qualquer configuração terminada em `*` como prefixo livre. Uma allowlist malformada como `https://trusted.example*` poderia aceitar `https://trusted.example.evil`. O commit `4200607483bcd51f3d77e6a96ba46c5159839360` restringe `scheme://host:*` a porta variável no hostname exato, rejeita userinfo/path/query/fragment e preserva somente os wildcards de esquema explícitos como `app://*` e `file://*`.

Regressões cobrem porta válida, hostname parecido e ausência de porta. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. A política local continua aplicando Origin a mutações sem bearer.


## Portabilidade P1 do sandbox best-effort — 2026-09-23

O commit `b4c4c243c43939b1fbbf81155226acee636be2ba` corrigiu uma lacuna multiplataforma: o caminho comum sempre tentava `unshare`, embora strict fosse Linux-only. O sandbox agora resolve Python/Node conforme o sistema e, em macOS/Windows, usa processo best-effort com timeout, limite de stdout/stderr e kill no cancelamento. O resultado declara `execution_isolation=best-effort-platform-process`, `resource_limits=context-timeout-output-bounded` e `network_isolation=not-enforced`. Strict continua recusado fora de Linux e não há downgrade silencioso.

Testes normais/race do sandbox passaram. O gate completo Go passou em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. Também foram compilados os testes de `internal/agent` para `GOOS=darwin` e `GOOS=windows` com `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Isso é prova de compilação multiplataforma, não homologação física de sistemas, dispositivos ou isolamento host.


## Hardening P1 do decoder JSON HTTP — 2026-09-23

A auditoria encontrou que `decodeJSON` já rejeitava campos desconhecidos, mas aceitava um segundo documento após o primeiro. O commit `f06891fc02397aca33ae4eaa04397911120f7d9c` exige EOF depois do único documento decodificado. Como dezenas de handlers de agentic reutilizam esse helper, a correção cobre connectors, plugins, Company OS, schedules, OAuth actions, missions e demais mutações que passam pelo parser comum.

Foram adicionados testes para segundo objeto, campo desconhecido e whitespace válido. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. A mudança é de parsing de request; autorização, approval e dependências externas continuam sendo verificadas separadamente.


## Limite P1 de bodies JSON agentic — 2026-09-23

O commit `09eb26eb33ec12ffd2b2558db3f4949c45e2e243` adicionou `http.MaxBytesReader` ao helper `decodeJSON`, limitando cada body JSON agentic a 4 MiB antes do parsing. A regra vale transversalmente aos handlers que reutilizam o helper e evita leitura ilimitada em endpoints que antes já tinham campos/EOF estritos.

A regressão cobre body acima do limite, além dos casos de campo desconhecido, documento trailing e whitespace válido. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff.


## Fechamento da exceção dev token — 2026-09-23

A revisão transversal do parser descobriu que `POST /api/agent/v1/auth/dev/token` usava `ShouldBindJSON` diretamente. O commit `6d00127af3341c32b3246c963be324db89f0e3e5` migrou o handler para `decodeJSON`, portanto o endpoint também recebe o limite de 4 MiB, rejeita campos desconhecidos e exige EOF. O gate de segurança do endpoint permanece: flag `OLLAMA_AGENT_AUTH_DEV=true` e peer loopback real.

Regressão normal/race confirma rejeição de campo inesperado antes de criar usuário/organização. Gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff.


## Hardening P1 do adapter de deploy — 2026-09-23

O commit `58cc1f40e478dba5b1b87dc452e172e86b9b2f42` endureceu o adapter de deployments. O workspace raiz agora rejeita symlink; redirects continuam bloqueados; o client padrão remove proxy, marca explicitamente endpoints loopback e rejeita o IP privado real após a conexão para hosts não-loopback. A configuração HTTP local aceita `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` e `::1`; endpoints externos exigem HTTPS.

Regressões cobrem deploy genérico fixture, root symlink, localhost HTTP e dial para endereço privado. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. Nenhum deploy Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Cloudflare ou outro foi executado; esses estados continuam `configured/available`, não `upstream validated`.


## Hardening P1 de inputs multimídia — 2026-09-23

O commit `f45aae49866c16f5b5be60ccb083715663af2896` endureceu `MediaManager`. `Transcribe` e `AnalyzeImage` agora aceitam somente arquivos regulares dentro do workspace, recusam workspace/input symlink e rejeitam traversal. A transcrição verifica o tamanho antes de abrir e falha acima de 100 MiB, em vez de truncar silenciosamente com `io.CopyN`. Outputs de imagem, vídeo e speech também validam o root antes de gravar.

Regressões cobrem provider TLS fixture, containment, symlink, arquivo grande, redirects, MIME/magic e limites. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff. O fixture local não comprova conta, quota ou provider externo conectado.


## Company Growth OS explicitamente sandbox-only — 2026-09-23

O commit `a286c15a8c26eda227a695e42889f2ccde34ecea` adicionou `mode: sandbox` a campaigns, affiliate programs/links e orders. `CompanyGrowthReport` agora expõe `sandbox_only=true`; registros legados são normalizados ao carregar; qualquer modo diferente de sandbox falha com `ErrCompanyGrowthExternalUnavailable` até existir adapter upstream validado.

O fluxo local preserva approval, orçamento, idempotência, inventário e métricas, mas não afirma campanha lançada, venda cobrada, fulfillment contratado ou conversão externa. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram em integrity, todos os pacotes, vet, build e diff.


## Correção P1 de safeConfig para manifests duráveis — 2026-09-23

O commit `fda916253cf408336ce25024ccdb24983d2fe626` corrigiu o endpoint de configuração segura. Antes, `connectors_configured`, `mcp_configured`, `media_configured` e `deployments_configured` dependiam somente das variáveis de bootstrap e podiam reportar `false` depois de um registro persistente pelo lifecycle.

Agora os campos combinam bootstrap estático com managers duráveis do Runtime. O teste registra um connector fixture, verifica `configured=true` e confirma que o endpoint não revela URL. A semântica continua restrita a configuração local; não é prova de credential presence, OAuth account ou upstream smoke. Testes normal/race e gates Go completos passaram.


## Reauditoria README/mídia/deploy — correções R01–R04 e captura observável — 2026-09-23

O snapshot `aee66ee988c99d2ed6da2e8e9fc1009e3c90592f` foi reconciliado com o HEAD antes da alteração. A reprodução temporária no pacote real confirmou R01, R02 e R03: `.agent-media` symlink permitia escrita externa antes de `BuildArtifactManifest`, `.env`/`.git/config` entravam no pacote de deploy e o dialer estabelecia TCP privado antes da recusa. R04 foi confirmado por arquivo esparso de `25 MiB + 1`: `AnalyzeImage` recusava depois de `os.ReadFile`.

O commit `06990ef573129da2e4a272b49435857b9e7f46c4` corrigiu a causa raiz. Outputs de mídia e OCR usam `os.Root`, paths relativos, rejeição de componentes symlink e criação limitada. Inputs de transcrição e visão usam descritor aberto pelo root, orçamento de leitura com cancelamento e detecção de crescimento. O diretório de output é validado antes de provider/ processo externo. O coletor de deploy exclui `.git`, metadados internos, `.env`, chaves, backups, logs e arquivos não regulares antes da leitura; o provider fixture confirmou que conteúdo privado sintético não chegou ao payload. O dialer resolve A/AAAA, rejeita qualquer endereço privado antes do TCP e disca o IP aprovado, preservando hostname da URL para Host/SNI; loopback só é permitido pelo contexto explícito.

As regressões permanentes passaram em normal e `-race`, com testes positivos de output legítimo, filtro de pacote, cancelamento, limite e ausência de TCP proibido. O pacote `internal/agent` também compilou para Darwin e Windows com `go test -c`; a tentativa inicial de `go test` cross-compile foi descartada como erro operacional de execução de binário estrangeiro, não como falha de compilação.

O commit `ec7f52c048c238510ca6dc08212cd2c10535bfe1` tornou `capture-parity-screens.mjs` relativo ao checkout, respeitou `SCREEN_OUTPUT` explícito, rejeitou base URL inválida, aguardou estado observável, executou interação segura por rota, coletou page/console/request/HTTP diagnostics e gravou manifesto com SHA/build/viewport/limitações. O preview distribuível foi servido por bridge local conectado ao backend Ollama real; dez rotas foram capturadas com interação, zero page errors, zero console errors inesperados, zero request failures inesperados e zero HTTP failures inesperados. As respostas 401/404 conhecidas de ausência de conta ou endpoints base sem implementação foram classificadas no manifesto, não escondidas.

A Home fornecida pelo mantenedor ainda segue o caminho documental separado a partir da main. O PR do produto não é base para trocar a imagem da página padrão; `README_MAIN_STATUS=PENDING_DOCS_MERGE` até aprovação e merge do PR documental independente.

Estado: `FIXING`; implementação e publicação dos commits R01–R04 e do capturador concluídas; homologação externa, contas, deploy real, dispositivos, lojas e CI do novo head continuam pendentes ou `BLOCKED_BY_EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY` conforme a matriz do readiness.


## Hardening da cadeia de dependências runtime da UI — 2026-09-23

O gate local completo iniciado no head `2f5674cf` passou por integrity, YAML, Go test, vet, build e testes/build da UI, mas parou em `app/ui/app/npm audit --omit=dev` com 12 vulnerabilidades runtime. O mobile não chegou a executar nesse runner abortado; a auditoria independente do mobile depois retornou zero vulnerabilidades.

A análise do grafo mostrou que `streamdown@1.4.0` trazia Mermaid 11.12, DOMPurify, lodash-es e uuid em runtime; `@tanstack/react-router-devtools` estava em `dependencies` apesar de não ser importado pela aplicação e trazia `solid-js/seroval`. O commit `eff054c14c38d824654fc44c095b910038bc9726` atualizou Streamdown para `2.6.0`, removeu o devtools não utilizado, declarou Shiki usado diretamente e fixou `mdast-util-to-hast` em `13.2.1` via override. O grafo runtime resultante não contém Mermaid, DOMPurify, lodash-es, seroval ou o devtools removido.

Evidência local pós-correção: Vitest 21 arquivos/204 testes, `npm run build`, `npm ci`/dry-run do lockfile, `npm audit --omit=dev` com zero vulnerabilidades, `apps/mobile-agentic/npm run typecheck` e `npm audit --omit=dev` com zero vulnerabilidades. O CI público do novo SHA ainda precisa concluir; a falha race macOS do head anterior não é reutilizada nem declarada resolvida.


## P1 de approval com motivo explícito na UI — 2026-09-23

A Agentic Console deixou de enviar o texto genérico `Aprovado no Agentic Console` ou `Rejeitado no Agentic Console`. O commit `720bbd9245ab4589a508e2627b976c5f7bbf577b` adicionou um campo por decisão, limita o motivo a 512 caracteres, bloqueia Aprovar/Rejeitar quando o texto está vazio e envia o motivo efetivamente escrito junto do nonce e da decisão. O campo é limpo depois de uma resposta aceita.

A regressão `AgenticConsole.approval.test.tsx` confirma que uma decisão sem motivo permanece bloqueada e que o POST contém `approved`, `nonce` e o texto explícito. No head anterior `f9ae5dd8`, o runner absoluto fechou `FULL_LOCAL_GATES=PASS`: integrity, YAML, `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test ./...`, vet, build Go, Vitest 22 arquivos/205 testes, build UI, audit UI/mobile, typecheck mobile e diff. O novo head `720bbd92` foi publicado e seu CI remoto ainda está em execução.
